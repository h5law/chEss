MAYBE:
- Rotate board for p1 always on bottom (seperate board representations)

BUGS:
- Queen bottom right search dismisses collisions
- King take in check to resolve doesn't wipe piece
- Random segfaults (add tracing/logging framework)

- Segfaults may be related to indexing into a state struct w/
  dereferencing error or bitboard/positions array
  Maybe incorrect square value when indexing into a masks array
  Check bitboards, masks and pointer dereferencing
